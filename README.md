# Rust WebAssembly React Template

Fork from [wasm-react-webpack-template](https://github.com/Fallenstedt/wasm-react-webpack-template)

## Setup

A simple 'yarn' and 'yarn start' should do the trick. File an issue if it doesn't!

`src` is where your rust code can go. `js` is where you can find your react :)
